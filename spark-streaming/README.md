# spark-streaming

Spark Streaming is part of Spark, but a special park specialized in treating streaming data.

Spark Streaming is a module of Apache Spark that enables the processing of real-time data streams. It allows you to take in data streams from various sources, such as Kafka, Flume, and Kinesis, and process them using the same operations as batch processing in Spark. This allows you to perform complex data processing tasks on live data streams in real-time, making it well suited for use cases like analytics, monitoring, and alerting.

In terms of downloading the jars, you can use the package management tool for your programming language, such as Maven for Java or pip for Python. These tools allow you to easily download and manage the necessary dependencies for your project, including the Spark Streaming jars. In addition, you can also download the jars from the Apache Spark website and add them to your classpath manually. Once you have the jars in your classpath, you can use the config method to specify the path to the jars in your Spark context, so that they are available to your Spark Streaming application.
